# EXCESSIVE RAINFALL IN STEATTLE 2014-2015

## Dataset and objective
My objective is to summarize a dataset of annual, daily precipitation in Seattle, WA. To create a meaningful narrative of the data, I believe that it is important to first think about whom and for what purpose the data would be used even if this is mainly intended to be a technical excerise.

I'd imagine that my client is a gardener for whom the volumn and duration of rainfall - or lack thereof - is of importance for their businesses. Unlike temperature, rainfalls accummulate in the ground. Thus, my client would be less interested in specific days of excessive rainfalls and more interested in the cummulative amount of rain as the year goes by and how slowly/quickly the this accummulation occurs.
